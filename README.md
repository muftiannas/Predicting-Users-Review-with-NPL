# Predicting-Users-Review-with-NPL

Film Junky Union, a new community for classic film fans is developing a system to filter and categorize movie reviews. Its main mission is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. We will use IMBD's dataset of film reviews with polarity labeling to create a model that can classify positive and negative reviews. This model must have at least an F1 score of 0.85.
